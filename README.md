# Wordle in C++
A C++ recreation of the popular Wordle game, implementing efficient data structures to provide dynamic and accurate feedback on user guessesâ€”just like the original game!

ðŸ›  Features & Implementation
- Optimized Word Storage: Used a hash set to store valid words for quick lookup and validation of user inputs.
- Letter Frequency Analysis: Implemented maps and arrays to track letter occurrences and determine correct letter placements.
- Feedback Mechanism: Designed a system using vectors and hash maps to efficiently assign letter-coded hints (Right(R), Maybe(M), Wrong(W)) based on letter positioning and repetition, ensuring it follows Wordle's exact   rules.
- Interactive CLI Interface: Built a smooth command-line interface that processes user guesses, displays hints, and guides players toward the correct word within a limited number of attempts.
- This project showcases algorithmic problem-solving, data structure optimization, and user-friendly gameplay design, all in pure C++.
